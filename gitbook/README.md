# Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis

## Objective 

The objective of this training program is to introduce participants with basic knowledge of *programming*, *debugging* and *x86 assembly language* to the art of Software Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis. Various use-cases for Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis along with live examples will be demonstrated during the session in order to impart a practical and result oriented training to the participants. The entire session will focus only on Win32 Platform however most of the techniques discussed are applicable for Win64 platform as well and some of them even for Linux or other Operating System platforms. Multiple CTF like challenges will be provided during the workshop in order to encourage the participants to try out various tools and techniques discussed during the session.
